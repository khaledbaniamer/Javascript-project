        <b>Q-LKSA company</b>  was founded in 1996, driven by the desire to democratize scientific research by expanding its availability, which meant
            giving scholarly publishers the software that they needed to excel in a new—and often intimidating—digital environment.<br> <br>
            Over the 25+ years that Literatum has been in continuous development, we’ve gained a deep understanding of what it takes to power a successful online publishing business. Our product development is driven in part by our clients’ requirements for their own businesses. New features are regularly added to meet the design, editorial, and marketing needs of our expanding client base.<br> <br>
            Today Q-LKSA has over 200 clients, including some of the world’s largest publishers; several date back to our first years in business. Literatum is home to 32 million articles in over 15,000 journals, as well as nearly half a million books, in over a dozen languages and on more than 900 publication websites. The platform logs over 5.1 billion user sessions annually.
